# About this Organization

The goal of this organization is to host and maintain all kinds of tools and libraries useful for operating system development in Rust. The organization's home page is https://rust-osdev.com, where _This Month in Rust OSDev_ is published.

If you're interested in Rust and OS development, please join us on [Zulip]!

Note that we are not an official Rust organization.
